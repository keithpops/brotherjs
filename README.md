BROTHER.JS
==========
**BROTHER.JS** is an automaton for your website. **BROTHER.JS** will follow you but if you get too close to his personal space, he will lose his mind. Give him ample rest so he can call out to his brothermaniacs. If brothermania runs too wild, you also have the option to destroy **BROTHER.JS**.

```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="assets/brother.css">
  <script type="text/javascript" src="assets/brother.js"></script>
  
  <a id="kill-brother" href="#">Kill Brother</a>
  <div id="brother" class="sprite"></div>
```
